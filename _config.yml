  Welcome to my portfolio page! Hope you enjoy all the things I'm interested in. I show off a lot of my work informally on my Twitter and sometimes YouTube.
  <br>
  Since 2015, my job has been designing and implementing creative toolset features for Media Molecule's game Dreams. Over the years I've mainly worked on Dreams' music and audio toolset,
  which is effectively an audio workstation inside a PS4 game. 
  <br>
  I've always been interested in audio and music, but I also have a fascination with game design, generative systems and many other things.
  I'm happy to discuss any of these topics over DM or e-mail.
