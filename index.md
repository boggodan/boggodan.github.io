### My Main Work

My main contribution over the past decade has been working on the toolset of Dreams, a PlayStation game. My original work was on the audio tools and engine that underpin music and audio creation. You can read a bit about it in this NME article! Recently I've been more of a generalist programmer, but still with a big focus on creativity and tools.
